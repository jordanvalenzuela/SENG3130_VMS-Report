## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 PURPOSE
This document defines the user requirements for the new Volunteer Management System for the city.  The information stated in this document will be used as the basis for subsequent development activities including design, implementation, testing, and post-implementation review.
### 1.2 PROJECT BACKGROUND
Since the COVID pandemic, daily care workers for seniors have significantly dropped.  It is estimated that there are 10000 to 15000 senior cases that the city needs to attend to; however, with the lack of workers, as well as the limited speed of the current system, the city is unable to meet the demands fast enough. As well, due to the limited number of teachers, there is a demand in the elementary school system for additional coaching and teaching for the students. At the moment, a lot of time is spent screening potential volunteers, and there is a lack of incentives for volunteers to contribute their time.  While people are recovering from the pandemic, we should be able to support children and seniors alike with the help of qualified volunteers.
### 1.3 BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
The high-level business objectives for the project are the following:
1. Reduce the application process time
2. Develop a centralized system that accurately keeps track of seniors
3. reduce volunteer assignment time by 30% (Seniors should get volunteer services within three days)
### 1.4 PROJECT SCOPE
The new VMS aims to provide volunteer support to seniors in need of assistance and elementary school children further tutoring.  

The major functions to be provided by the system are listed below:\
a) Creation, updating, and deletion of volunteer and senior profiles\
b) Approve volunteer applications for service\
c) Generate daily reports of a forecasted number of senior cases for the next week
### 1.5 PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The project objectives are to\
a) Decrease the number of senior cases in the city\
b) Decrease volunteer assignment time by 30%
